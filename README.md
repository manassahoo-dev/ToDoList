# ToDoList

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Here's a list of functionalities you can include in your TODO App using React and Redux Toolkit:

1. **Task List Display:**
   - Display a list of tasks (TODOs) with their titles and completion status.
   - Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as complete/incomplete.
   - Include a delete button for each task to remove it from the list.

2. **Add New Task:**
   - Provide an input field to add new tasks.
   - Allow users to press 'Enter' or click a button to add a new task to the list.

3. **Task Filtering:**
   - Allow users to filter tasks based on their completion status (e.g., show all tasks, only completed tasks, only incomplete tasks).

4. **Task Editing:**
   - Implement the ability to edit task titles directly in place.
   - Show an edit icon or double-click to enter edit mode.

5. **Task Completion:**
   - When a user clicks the checkbox, update the completion status of the task.
   - Apply appropriate styling to differentiate completed and incomplete tasks.

6. **Task Deletion:**
   - When the delete button is clicked, remove the task from the list.
   - Confirm the deletion with a modal or a confirmation dialog.

7. **Task Count:**
   - Display the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.

8. **Local Storage:**
   - Persist tasks in local storage to retain the task list even after a page refresh.

9. **Redux Integration:**
   - Set up Redux Toolkit to manage the state of your application, including tasks and their completion status.

10. **Redux Actions:**
    - Define Redux actions to handle adding, editing, marking as complete/incomplete, and deleting tasks.

11. **Redux Reducers:**
    - Create Redux reducers to update the state based on the dispatched actions.

12. **Thunks for Async Actions:**
    - Implement Redux Thunks to handle asynchronous actions like saving tasks to local storage.

13. **Styling:**
    - Apply CSS styles to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.

14. **Responsive Design:**
    - Ensure your app works well on different screen sizes and devices.

15. **Error Handling:**
    - Handle potential errors, such as failing to load tasks from local storage.

16. **Unit Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for Redux actions, reducers, and components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

17. **Documentation:**
    - Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the app, including any prerequisites.

18. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your app to a hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) for others to access.

Remember that this is just a comprehensive list of functionalities you can include. You can customize and extend these functionalities based on your specific requirements and preferences.
